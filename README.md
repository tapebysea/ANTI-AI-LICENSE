# 🎏 OFCPL 1.0 🎏
The OFCPL 1.0, or Open, Fair, Creative-Protective License 1.0 is a license applicable to software, art  and any other creative works. It is written to be permissive, open, and pragmatic, while protecting the copyrighted work in the case it is used as training material for machine learning algorithms. Feel free to take and use it :)

# Design
The general design principals are that;

  1. It should follow general open source and software freedom guidelines and principals

  2. It should be permissive towards usage in derivative works

  3. It should clarify that derivative works are distributed under the same license (See CC BY-SA 3.0 for example)

  4. It should restrict the usage of the copyrighted work in ML algorithms

It's design is open-source first, and following the layout/concepts of CC BY-SA 3.0 (Creative Commons Attribution-Sharalike Unported 3.0)

# Purpose
The reason I'm writing this license is to provide an open source license for software and art that does not wish to forfeit to entites who are able to blatently violate the copyright of individuals. Copyright and Intellecual Property law were enacted to protect the rights of the creative individual, but are now being used as a tool to evade, profit and control. This is in my opinion, not in the spirit of open source. Openness shouldn't mean you are forfeiting your copyrighted works to corporations who simply want control.

> Note; While no license can fully prevent ML algorithms from scraping copyrighted data, I personally believe that a license like this is necessary simply out of principle. Always be aware that your license of choice is only as good as your ability to defend yourself in court.
