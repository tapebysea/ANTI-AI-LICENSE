# OFCPL 1.0
The OFCPL 1.0, or Open, Fair, Creative-Protective License 1.0 is a license applicable to software, art, music, and any other similar creative work. Feel free to use as you see fit. My intent is to provide an Open Source license that does not wish to forfeit to entites who are able to blatently violate the copyright of individuals for the sake of "progress". To put it another way, this is a strictly ANTI-AI license. Openness and fairness should not mean you are forfeiting your copyrighted works to be devoured and regurgitated by a thoughtless machine whose intent is solely to profit.
