# OFCPL 1.0
The OFCPL 1.0, or Open, Fair, Creative-Protective License 1.0 is a license applicable to software, art, music, and any other similar creative work. Feel free to use it as you see fit. 

# Why?
My intent is to provide an Open Source license that does not wish to forfeit to entites who are able to blatently violate the copyright of individuals for the sake of "progress". To put it another way, this is a strictly ANTI-AI license. Openness and fairness should not mean you are forfeiting your copyrighted works to be devoured and regurgitated by a thoughtless machine whose intent is solely to profit. Copyright and Intellecual Property law were enacted to protect the rights of the creative individual, but are now being used as a tool to evade, profit and control. This is in my opinion, not in the spirit of Open Source. The spirit of Open Source is of pragmatism, collaboration
