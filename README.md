# 🎏 OFCPL 1.0 🎏
The OFCPL 1.0, or Open, Fair, Creative-Protective License 1.0 is a license applicable to software, art  and any other creative works. It's written to be permissive, open, and pragmatic, while protecting your copyrighted work in case it's used as training material for machine learning algorithms. Feel free to take and use it :)

# Design
The general design principals are that;

  1. It should follow general open source and software freedom principals

  2. It should be permissive towards usage in derivative works, and require attribution

  3. It should require that derivative works are distributed under the same license.
     
  4. It should restrict the usage of the copyrighted work in ML algorithms

The OFCPL 1.0 is an open-source-like license, however it takes some liberties as to put fair restrictions on the scraping of code/art.

# Purpose
The reason I'm writing this license is to provide an open-source-like license for the creators of software and art who don't want to forfeit to entites who blatently violate the copyright of individuals. Copyright and Intellecual Property law were enacted to protect the rights of creative individuals, but are now being used as a tool to evade, profit and control. In my opinion, this is not in the spirit of open source / software freedom. Open source shouldn't mean forfeiting your copyrighted work to corporations who simply want control you.

> Note; While no license can prevent ML algorithms from scraping copyrighted data, I personally believe that a license like this is necessary simply out of principle. Always be aware that your license is only as good as your ability to defend yourself in court.

# Open-Source...?
The definition of free and open source is being eroded every day, and I refuse to contribute to that. As stated before, the OFCPL 1.0 is open-source-like; due to the nature of the restrictions placed on use in macine learning algoritms, it does not fall under the definition of open-source as defined by the OSI. My goal is to follow the principals of open-source and software freedom as closely as possible while protecting developers and creatives from having their work scraped for machine learning algorithms.
