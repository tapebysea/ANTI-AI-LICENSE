The definition of free and open source is being eroded every day, and I refuse to contribute to that.
As stated before, the OFCPL 1.0 is open-source-like; due to the nature of the restrictions placed on
use in macine learning algoritms, it does not fall under the definition of open-source as defined by
the OSI. My goal is to follow the principals of open-source and software freedom as closely as possible
while protecting developers and creatives from having their work scraped for machine learning algorithms.
